# Hi, I'm Graham Pellegrini ðŸ‘‹

**B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Engineering â€“ Class of 2025**  
University of Malta

I'm passionate about **Signal Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI Integration**, especially in low-level systems and real-time environments. My academic and personal work revolves around building intelligent, efficient, and interpretable systems â€” from **microcontroller-based solutions** to **deep learning pipelines**.

I strive to combine **logical reasoning** and **critical thinking** with a hands-on approach to technology and design. My curiosity drives me to build solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful and elegant.
